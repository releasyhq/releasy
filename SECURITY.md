# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest `main` branch. Other versions and
forks may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories for this
repository. If you prefer email or cannot use GitHub, contact us at
[contact@releasyhq.com](mailto:contact@releasyhq.com). If private reporting is
not available, open a GitHub
issue with only non-sensitive details and we will follow up to move the
discussion to a private channel.

Please do not disclose security issues publicly until we have had a chance to
investigate and respond.
